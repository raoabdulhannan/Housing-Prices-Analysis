Predicting Effect of Distance from Rail Trails on House Prices

This report analyzes home value trends from 1998 to 2014, concentrating on properties with less than 0.56 acres of land. The primary objective was to identify the key factors that drive the appreciation of home values within this specific segment of the housing market. To achieve this, we employed statistical methods such as regression analysis to explore the relationships between home value increases and various potential factors, including location, property size, and proximity to amenities like schools, parks, and shopping centers. Additionally, we considered the impact of the broader economic conditions during the study period on property values. Our findings indicate that location is the most significant factor influencing home value growth, followed by the size of the property and the availability of nearby amenities. Homes located in desirable neighborhoods with good schools and convenient access to services tended to appreciate more consistently. By excluding two homes that experienced over \$500,000 in value increases due to major renovations, we ensured that the results reflect typical market behavior rather than being skewed by exceptional cases. This approach provides a clearer understanding of the primary drivers behind home value increases for properties within the specified land size.
